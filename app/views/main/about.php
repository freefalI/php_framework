    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
        ZEBRA has seen some remarkable accomplishments over the past 30 years.</p>

    <p>
        With a goal to become an $8 billion company by 2017 and open 600 stores in the next three years, it’ll be exciting to see
        the company achieve in three years what it initially took 30 years to do.

    <h3>
        Did you know...</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        ZEBRA is the 5th largest specialty retailer in the United States.</p>
    <p>
        A customer from Toronto named her daughter Tiev Forever Golding because she almost had her baby in a ZEBRA store. Once the
        child’s passport expires, they plan to legally change her first name to ZEBRA.
    </p>
    <p>
        The average ZEBRA store is 38,000 square feet, the largest is approximately 162,000 square feet and the original ZEBRA store
        is only 900 square feet.
    </p>
    <p>
        ZEBRA rung up $700,000 in sales in its first year. The prior three businesses that occupied that building failed within the
        first year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even with the company’s tremendous growth, it still remains a family owned business.
